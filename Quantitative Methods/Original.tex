\section*{Problem 1}
 \noindent
 This question has 2 parts.
 \subsection*{Part 1:}
 Suppose that $F$ and $X$ are events from a common sample space with $P(F) \neq 0$ and $P(X) \neq 0$.
 \\
 \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
     \item Prove that $P(X) = P(X|F)P(F) + P(X|\bar{F})P(\bar{F})$. Hint: Explain why $P(X|F)P(F) = P(X \cap F)$ is another way of writing the definition of conditional probability, and then use that with the logic from the proof of Theorem 4.1.1.
     \\\\
     %Enter your answer below this comment line.  
     \\\\
     \item Explain why $P(F|X) = P(X|F)P(F)/P(X)$ is another way of stating Theorem 4.2.1 Bayes’ Theorem.
     \\\\
     %Enter your answer below this comment line.  
     \\\\
 \end{enumerate}
 \subsection*{Part 2:}
 A website reports that 70\% of its users are from outside a certain country. Out of their users from outside the country, 60\% of them log on every day. Out of their users from inside the country, 80\% of them log on every day.
 \\
 \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item What percent of all users log on every day? Hint: Use the equation from Part 1 (a).
 \\\\
 %Enter your answer below this comment line.

  \section*{Problem 2}
 \noindent
 This question has 2 parts.
 \subsection*{Part 1:}
 The drawing below shows a Hasse diagram for a partial order on the set:
 \\
   $\{A, \;B,\; C,\; D,\; E,\; F,\; G,\; H,\; I, \; J\}$
 \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{NewHasse}
 \end{center}
 {\color{blue} {\bf Figure 1:} \emph{A Hasse diagram shows 10 vertices and 8 edges. The vertices, represented by dots, are as follows:  vertex J is upward of vertex H; vertex H is upward of vertex I; vertex B is inclined upward to the left of vertex A; vertex C is upward of vertex B; vertex D is inclined upward to the right of vertex C; vertex E is inclined upward to the left of vertex F; vertex G is inclined upward to the right of vertex E. The edges, represented by line segments between the vertices are as follows: 3 vertical edges connect the following vertices: B and C, H and I, and H and J; 5 inclined edges connect the following vertices: A and B, C and D, D and E, E and F, and E and G. 
  }
  }
  \\\\
 Determine the properties of the Hasse diagram based on the following questions:

  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item What are the minimal elements of the partial order?
\\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.  
\\\\
    \item What are the maximal elements of the partial order?
\\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.  
\\\\
    \item Which of the following pairs are comparable?
\[(A,\, D),\; (J,\, F),\; (B,\, E),\; (G,\, F),\; (D,\, B),\; (C,\, F),\; (H,\, I), (C,\, E)\]
\\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.  
\\\\
   \end{enumerate}
   \newpage
~\\
\subsection*{Part 2:}
Consider the partial order with domain $\{3,\, 5,\, 6, \,7,\, 10,\, 14,\, 20,\, 30,\, 60,\, 70\}$ and with $x\,\leq \,y$ if $x$ evenly divides $y$. Select the correct Hasse diagram for the partial order.

  \section*{Problem 6}
A lake initially contains 1000 fish. Suppose that in the absence of predators or other causes of removal, the fish population increases by 10\% each month. However, factoring in all causes, 80 fish are lost each month.\\

Give a recurrence relation for the population of fish after $n$ months. How many fish are there after 5 months? If your fish model predicts a non-integer number of fish, round down to the next lower integer.
