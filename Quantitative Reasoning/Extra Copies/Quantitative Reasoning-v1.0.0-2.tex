\section*{Problem 1}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item The domain for all variables in the expressions below is the set of real numbers. {\bf Determine whether each statement is true or false.}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item $\forall\, x\; \exists \,y\;(x\,+\,y\;\geq \;0)$
\\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Solution: This statement is true. For any real number x, you can always find a real number y such that their sum equals results in a positive number. For instance, if y is chosen to be the absolute value of x (y = |x|), then x + y will always be greater than or equal to 0, considering that |x| will either result in a positive number or a zero.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
\\\\
  \item $\exists \, x\; \forall \,y\;(x\,\cdot\,y\;>\; 0)$
   \\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Solution: This statement is false. There is no single real number x that can be multiplied with every real number y to always result in a product greater than 0. For example, if x is positive, then there is a negative y such that x * y is negative. If x is negative, then there is a positive y such that x * y is negative. And if x is zero, then x * y is always zero, which is not greater than 0.

\item {\bf Translate each of the following English statements into logical expressions.}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item There are two numbers whose ratio is less than $1$.
   \\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Solution: The logical expression for this statement is: ∃a, b ∈ ℝ (a/b < 1 ∧ b ≠ 0). This means there exist two real numbers a and b such that a divided by b is less than 1, and b is not equal to zero to avoid division by zero.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\\\\
  \item The reciprocal of every positive number is also positive.
   \\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Solution: The logical expression for this statement is: ∀x ∈ ℝ⁺ (1/x > 0). This means for all x in the set of positive real numbers, the reciprocal of x (which is 1/x) is greater than 0.

  \section*{Problem 2}
  Prove the following using the specified technique:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Let $x$ and $y$ be two real numbers such that $x + y$ is rational. Prove by contrapositive that if $x$ is irrational, then $x - y$ is irrational.
          \\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Solution: To prove by contrapositive, we assume that x - y is rational and then show that x must also be rational. Suppose x - y is a rational number. Since x + y is rational by hypothesis, and the sum of two rational numbers is rational, then (x - y) + 2y = x + y must also be rational. Because y is a real number and real numbers are closed under multiplication, 2y is rational. Therefore, if x - y is rational, then adding the rational number 2y to it yields another rational number, which is x + y. By the closure property of rational numbers under addition, x must be rational. This proves by contrapositive that if x is irrational, then x - y must be irrational.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
\\\\
    \item Prove by contradiction that for any positive two real numbers, $x$ and $y$,
         if $x\cdot y\, \leq \,50$, then either $x < 8$ or $y < 8$.
          \\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Solution: To prove by contradiction, assume the opposite of what we want to prove is true: both x and y are greater than or equal to 8. Then x * y would be at least 8 * 8, which is 64. However, this contradicts the given statement that x * y ≤ 50. Therefore, our assumption must be false, and we conclude that if x * y ≤ 50, then either x < 8 or y < 8.

  \section*{Problem 3}
  Let $n\, \geq \, 1$, $x$ be a real number, and $x\, \geq\,-1$. {\bf Prove the following statement using mathematical induction.}
  \[(1\,+\,x)^n\;\geq\;1\,+\,nx\]
\\\\
  %Enter your answer below this comment line.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Solution: Using mathematical induction, we need to prove the base case and the inductive step.
\\\\
Starting with the base case \(n = 1\): 
\[(1 + x)^1 = 1 + x = 1 + 1 \cdot x\]\\
The base case holds true since both sides are equal.
\\\\
Next, using the inductive step to prove the statement for \(n + 1\):
\\
Assume for induction that for some \(k \geq 1\), the statement is true:\\
\[(1 + x)^k \geq 1 + kx\]
We need to prove that:\\
\[(1 + x)^{k + 1} \geq 1 + (k + 1)x\]
Starting with the left side:

\begin{align*}
(1 + x)^{k + 1} &= (1 + x)^k \cdot (1 + x) \\
&\geq (1 + kx) \cdot (1 + x) \quad \text{(by the induction hypothesis)} \\
&= 1 + x + kx + kx^2 \\
&\geq 1 + x + kx \quad \text{(since \(x^2 \geq 0\) and \(k \geq 1\), thus \(kx^2 \geq 0\))} \\
&= 1 + (k + 1)x
\end{align*}
\\
This confirms the statement for \(k + 1\), and by the principle of mathematical induction, it follows that:
\[(1 + x)^n \geq 1 + nx\]
is true for all \(n \geq 1\) and \(x \geq -1\), as required.

  \section*{Problem 5}
  A class with n kids lines up for recess. The order in which the kids line up is random with each ordering being equally likely. There are two kids in the class named Betty and Mary. The use of the word ``$or$'' in the description of the events, should be interpreted as the inclusive or. That is ``$A \;or\; B$'' means that $A$ is true, $B$ is true, or both $A$ and $B$ are true.\\\\
  What is the probability that Betty is first in line or Mary is last in line as a function of $n$? Simplify your final expression as much as possible and include an explanation of how you calculated this probability.
