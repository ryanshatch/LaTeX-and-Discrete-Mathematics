In order to see if the two graphs are equal, I had to make sure that they have the same set of vertices and the same set of edges.\\\\
\textbf{Graph in Figure 1:}\\
Vertices: a, b, c, d, e\\
Edges: ab, ac, bc, cd, ed, ec\\\\
\textbf{Graph (adjacency list) in Figure 2:}\\
Vertex a: connected to b, c\\
Vertex b: connected to a, c\\
Vertex c: connected to a, b, d, e\\
Vertex d: connected to c, e\\
Vertex e: connected to c, d\\\\
The adjacency list for Figure 2 matches the connections in the graph from Figure 1, so these two representations are of the same graph. Thus, the graphs in Figure 1 and Figure 2 are equal.

Adjacency Matrix:\\

Vertex e is connected to b, d\\\\
These connections match the edges listed in the visual representation of the graph in Figure 3. Thus, the graph and its adjacency matrix representation are equal.

For two graphs to be isomorphic, there must be a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the number of edges and the connectivity is preserved.\\\\

\textbf{Graph in the first diagram of Figure 4:}\\
Vertices: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\
Edges: 12, 23, 15, 25, 53, 24, 36, 65, 54\\

\textbf{Graph in the second diagram of Figure 4:}\\
Vertices: a, b, c, d, e, f\\
Edges: ad, ac, ae, ab, db, af, ef, cf, bf\\\\
To prove isomorphism, I had to find a mapping from the vertices of the first graph to the second such that the edges correspond.\\\\
For example:\\
Map 1 to a, 2 to d, 3 to c, 4 to f, 5 to e, and 6 to b.\\
If the edges are checked, you will see that each edge in the first graph has a corresponding edge in the second graph with the mapped vertices.\\
Thus, the two graphs are isomorphic because there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices that preserves the edges.
\\\\
\item Show that the pair of graphs are not isomorphic by showing that there is a property that is preserved under isomorphism which one graph has and the other does not.\\

Undirected edges, line segments, are between the following vertices: 1 and 2; 2 and 3; 3 and 4; 4 and 5; and 5 and 1. The second graph has 4 vertices, a through d. Vertices d and c are horizontally inline, where vertex d is to the left of vertex c. Vertex a is above and between vertices d and c. vertex b is to the right and below vertex a, but above the other two vertices. Undirected edges, line segments, are between the following vertices: a and b; b and c; a and d; d and c; d and b.

To show two graphs are not isomorphic, I had to identify a graph invariant (a property that does not change under isomorphism) that is different in the two graphs.\\\\

In this case, I used the degree sequence as an invariant.\\
The degree sequence for the first graph is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2) since every vertex has exactly two neighbors.\\\\
For the second graph, the degree sequence is (3, 2, 2, 1), since there is one vertex connected to three others, two vertices connected to two others, and one vertex connected to only one other.\\

Since the degree sequences are not the same, the two graphs cannot be isomorphic. Another invariant is the number of cycles: the first graph contains a single cycle that includes all its vertices, whereas the second graph does not have a cycle that includes all its vertices. This also shows that the graphs are not isomorphic.

    To decode ``111001101110010'' using the tree, I once again followed the binary sequence to get the characters:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item 111: y\\
    \item 0: a\\
    \item 11: d\\
    \item 0: a\\
    \item 11: d\\
    \item 101: n\\
    \item 0: a\\
    \item 10: d\\
\end{itemize}
    The sequence decodes to "yadadna".

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Use Prim's algorithm to compute the minimum spanning tree for the weighted graph. Start the algorithm at vertex a. Show the order in which the edges are added to the tree.\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
Using Prim's algorithm starting at vertex a, the minimum spanning tree is constructed by adding the edges in the following order:\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Add edge {a, e} with weight 2.\\
        \item Add edge {e, f} with weight 2.\\
        \item Add edge {d, f} with weight 1.\\
        \item Add edge {c, a} with weight 5.\\
        \item Add edge {c, b} with weight 5.\\\\
    \end{itemize}
    The edges added form the minimum spanning tree with a total weight of 15.\\\\

\item What is the minimum weight spanning tree for the weighted graph in the previous question subject to the condition that edge $\{d,\, e\}$ is in the spanning tree?\\\\
    %Enter your answer here.
To include the edge {d, e} in the minimum spanning tree, the edges are added in the following order:\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Include edge {d, e} by default.\\
        \item Add edge {d, f} with weight 1.\\
        \item Add edge {e, a} with weight 2.\\
        \item Add edge {e, f} with weight 2.\\
        \item Add edge {c, b} with weight 5.\\\\
    \end{itemize}
The edges added form the minimum spanning tree with the edge {d, e} included and a total weight of 17.\\\\

\item How would you generalize this idea? Suppose you are given a graph G and a particular edge $\{u,\,v\}$ in the graph. How would you alter Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree subject to the condition that $\{u,\,v\}$ is in the tree?\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
To generalize this idea for any given edge {u, v} in the graph, Prim's algorithm is modified as follows:\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Include the edge {u, v} in the tree from the beginning.\\
    \item Perform Prim's algorithm starting from vertex u or v, considering all other edges except {u, v}.\\
    \item Grow the tree by selecting the edges with the smallest weight while avoiding cycles until all vertices are included in the tree.\\\\
\end{enumerate}
This makes sure that the resulting tree is a minimum spanning tree with the specific edge {u, v} included.
